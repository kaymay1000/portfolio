What (I think) I need to do for portfolio 11 assignment:

1. include page.js script tag in my index.html
2. create a routes.js file and specify desired routes to different areas of my site
and be sure to call page() at the bottom of the file
3. update main nav so that each tab is assigned to a specific route
